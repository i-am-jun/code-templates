# 🧑‍💼 Stages of an Interview

Most algorithmic interviews last **45–60 minutes** and follow this structure.

---

## 1. 🔹 Introductions

- Prepare a **30–60 sec intro**
- Mention: work experience, tech stack, interests
- Listen carefully to the interviewer’s intro  
- Connect on any common interest

---

## 2. 🔍 Problem Statement Clarification

**Before writing any code, do this:**

### Ask clarifying questions:
- What does input look like?
- Bounds on input size?
- Sorted or unsorted?
- Can input be empty?
- Any constraints?

### Confirm understanding:
- Repeat the problem in your own words  
- Walk through an example

This shows you are systematic and detail-oriented.

---

## 3. 🧠 Brainstorming Approaches

Think out loud. Explore patterns like:

- Sliding window  
- Two pointers  
- Hashing  
- Backtracking  
- BFS/DFS  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Binary search  
- Graph/tree techniques  

Outline the chosen approach and wait for confirmation before coding.

---

## 4. 👨‍💻 Implementation

- Ask before using libraries  
- Write clean, readable code  
- Use helper functions where possible  
- Explain your thought process while coding  
- Start with brute force if stuck → optimize later

---

## 5. 🧪 Testing & Debugging

### Environment types:
1. **Tests auto-run** (like LeetCode)
2. **You write tests, code executes**
3. **You write tests, code does NOT execute**

For manual environments:
- Dry-run your code  
- Track variable changes  
- Compare expected vs actual  

If you hit a bug:  
👉 Don’t panic — talk through your debugging process.

---

## 6. ⚙️ Follow-up Questions

Be prepared to explain:

- Time complexity  
- Space complexity  
- Tradeoffs  
- Is your solution optimal?  
- How to improve it?

Interviewers evaluate your thinking more than correctness.

---

## 7. 👋 Outro – Your Questions to the Interviewer

Ask thoughtful questions:

- What does a typical day look like?  
- What's the team structure?  
- What are the current big challenges?  
- What’s your favorite part of working here?

Be engaged and show curiosity.
